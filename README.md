# Enhancing LLM with Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG)

## Project Description
The "Enhancing LLM with Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG)" project is an innovative initiative designed to significantly enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our goal is to integrate these models with the latest content from recent journal volumes and other up-to-date sources, improving their ability to provide current and relevant information. This is especially crucial for tasks that demand the most recent knowledge, such as grant proposals, literature reviews, and curriculum development.

Our approach involves 'fine-tuning' advanced LLMs with newly published materials, thereby improving the model's response quality by making it more relevant and informed. This process represents a dynamic and efficient method for keeping LLMs updated with the latest data, moving away from traditional retraining methods.

## Project Plan

### LangChain Integration
- **Framework Utilization**: We are utilizing LangChain, an open-source framework designed to streamline the development of applications using LLMs. LangChain provides essential functionalities such as memory reduction and result chaining, which are integral to our project.

### Document Ingestion and Processing
- **Update System**: Our project includes a comprehensive system for ingesting and processing new documents regularly. This ensures that our LLMs have access to the most recent information, enabling them to deliver more accurate and up-to-date responses.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Implementation
- **Hybrid Model Development**: At the core of our project is the implementation of RAG. This hybrid model combines the capabilities of LLMs with the latest retrieved information. It employs query embeddings to search a vector database for pertinent document chunks, providing a rich context for the LLM to generate informed responses.

### Deployment and User Interface
- **User-Friendly Access**: The system will be deployed with an emphasis on user accessibility and efficiency. We are focusing on creating an intuitive user interface that allows straightforward interactions with the enhanced LLM, ensuring quick and accurate responses.
- **Backend Optimization**: Back-end optimizations are being implemented to guarantee speedy data retrieval and smooth user experiences.

### Ongoing Development and Challenges
- **Continuous Improvement**: We anticipate facing challenges related to optimizing cloud platforms and storage solutions, addressing retrieval inefficiencies, and ongoing software development. Our team is committed to overcoming these challenges to ensure the project's success and continual enhancement.

This README provides an overview of our project's ambitions and methodologies. We are excited about the potential impact this project will have in enhancing LLMs' capabilities and making them more relevant in the ever-evolving landscape of information technology.
